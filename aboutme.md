My name is Casey Troxler, I am a graduate student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. I'm studying Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Heat Transfer. Currently I am working on research in Thermal Energy Storage using Phase Change Materials. I perform experimental and computational investigative work and I plan to use this website as documenation of achievements and career news.
