My name is Casey Troxler, I am a graduate student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. I'm studying Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Heat Transfer. Currently I am working on research in Thermal Energy Storage using Phase Change Materials. I perform experimental as well as computational work and I plan to use this website as documenation of neat resources I find online and of procedures or codes that I develop myself.
