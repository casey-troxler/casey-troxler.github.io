I will be presenting experimental and numerical results pertaining to the melting of Lauric Acid at suboptimal angles at the International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition 2021. 

The conference will be online, there will be a recorded presentation of my results and a Q&A afterwards for any questions.
