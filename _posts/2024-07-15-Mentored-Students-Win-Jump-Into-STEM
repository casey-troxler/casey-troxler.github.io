This year I had the opportunity to act as the Teaching Assistant for the Mechanical Engineering Energy-Systems Track Capstone Courses. I mentored the students working on the Jump Into STEM Competition sponsored by the Department of Energy. The group was a finalist on the first portion and then the two students, Jared Williams and Spencer Marinac, eligible for the second portion of the competition presented to Lab and Industry professionals about their concept. 

Pictured below, Spencer left and Jared right, were finalists in the competition and had the opportunity to intern with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory respectively. I am super proud of both of them for their accomplishments and excited to work with them when they return to Embry-Riddle for graduate school next semester.
